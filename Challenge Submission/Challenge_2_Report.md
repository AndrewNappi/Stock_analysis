# Summary
- Advantages of refactoring Code:
    - Refactoring code is like refining a gem. The code can start out dirty and ugly, but after extended time is spent with it you can make it beautiful.
    - As you spend more time with the code you can add comments to it and make it easier to come back to and understand.
    - Debugging becomes a process that must be done as you spend more time with the code. if you continuously change the code things can ge mixed up. 
    
- Disadvantages of refactoring Code:
    - Spending time with the code is one of the positives of refactoring old code, but its all about mindset. If you are happy to refactor your code its an advantage. If you are unhappy to refactor your code it can breed contempt for the program and might become a painful process for someone.
